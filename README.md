# Mango-leaf-disease-detection
A deep learning-based solution for identifying 8 classes of mango leaf diseases. This project demonstrates a full implementation of a computer vision pipeline using TensorFlow/Keras to assist in early and accurate plant disease diagnosis.
Project Overview
This repository is structured as a playlist/project series:

Part 1: Data Preprocessing - Code for loading, augmenting, and standardizing the mango leaf image dataset. Includes visualization of the preprocessed training set.

Part 2: Model Architecture - Implementation of the neural network designed specifically for this classification task.
